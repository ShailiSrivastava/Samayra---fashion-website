SAMAYRA — Smart Fashion Recommendation Platform

SAMAYRA is a fashion-tech web platform designed to help users choose clothing that complements their body type and personal comfort — reducing outfit regret and improving confidence.

The project combines UX design, frontend development, and intelligent personalization, without relying on heavy or opaque machine-learning systems.
 Problem Statement

Many people buy or wear outfits without considering their body proportions, only to later feel that the outfit doesn’t suit them.
Existing fashion platforms often:

Focus only on trends, not individuals

Use confusing or invasive sizing tools

Overuse AI without transparency

SAMAYRA solves this by offering a clear, ethical, and explainable “Find Your Fit” experience.
Solution Overview

SAMAYRA introduces a guided personalization flow:

Fit Look (Find Your Fit)
A short quiz identifies the user’s silhouette based on comfort and proportions.

Camera-Assisted Mode (Beta)
A live camera preview refines confidence in recommendations without saving images or performing measurements.

Persistent Personalization
Fit results are stored locally and used to personalize the Collection experience.

Smart Collection Filtering
The Collection page automatically highlights styles best suited to the user’s saved fit.
